This is a web scraping project that scrapes job listings from Indeed using Selenium and ChromeDriver. The project is designed to extract job details such as job titles, company names, job descriptions, application links, and other relevant information. It then stores the data in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- ChromeDriver (Download ChromeDriver from the official website: [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads))

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium undetected-chromedriver csv
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bilalacode/indeed-job-scraper.git
cd indeed-job-scraper
```

2. Download ChromeDriver and place it in the project directory [Note: This program is optimized for Windows. There are comments where subprocesses are used. If you want to use this for Unix-like systems, please change those. Also, download the chrome-drvier suitable for your system].

3. Run the main script to start scraping job listings:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. You can either scrape for a single indeed job search by providing a link. Alternatively, you can edit the generate_links.py to scrape multiple search terms with multiple states.

The script will open Chrome with the provided URL and start extracting job details. It will then save the data to `job_details.csv`.
